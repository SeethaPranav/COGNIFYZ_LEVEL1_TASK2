# Task: City-wise Restaurant Count and Ratings

## Description
This project identifies which city has the highest number of restaurants and also examines the average rating of restaurants by city. The analysis helps understand both market size and customer satisfaction across locations.

### What Was Done:
- Grouped the data by `City` and counted the number of restaurant entries.
- Calculated the average `Aggregate rating` for restaurants in each city.
- Identified the city with the highest number of restaurants and the city with the highest average rating.

### Insights:
- Cities with the most restaurants represent larger market potential.
- Some cities have fewer restaurants but higher average ratings, indicating strong local quality or customer satisfaction.
